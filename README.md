Amortization Program for creating a table of payments

This is an amortization table for home mortgages, but it should work for anything else that follows that type of math - say a car loan.

Right now it outputs to a .csv file for importing into a spreadsheet or outputs to the screen. 

If you create a file called extraprinciple you can put numbers with each line representing a month of extra principle payments.  Put a 0 for months without extra principle paid off.
