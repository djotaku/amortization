As of 20190925 this isn't all set up yet, but here's where I'm headed with the contributions for this project:

-Master should always be equivalent to a release or release-ready. Make pull requests into the development branch.
-Pull requests will be required to pass the Pythonapp Github action. At this time this means passing the flake8 linter and pytest. 
Some errors may be waved at my discretion.
